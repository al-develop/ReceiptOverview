## Made with

    Avalonia UI 11.0.10
    C# & dotnet 7.0
    Icons8

## Build for

    Fedora Linux
    Windows 10

(not tested on other systems, but should build and run wherever the dotnet 7.0 Runtime is installed)

## For Code-Readers

The goal was fast development, with no plans to expand further than the base functionalities.
Therefore, maintenance was not a priority, which results in a somewhat messy Codebase by design.
